## AESEncrypt - Encrypt and Decrypt files using AES

This is a C++ program that encrypts and decrypts files using the AES algorithm. The program uses a raw alogorithmic implementation of AES, and is not intended for production use. The program is intended for educational purposes only.

### Purpose

The purpose of this program is to gain a better understanding of how the AES algorithm works. The program is not intended for production use, and should not be used to encrypt sensitive data. This is a self-improvement project to learn more about the AES algorithm and how it works at a fundamental level.

The project is also to reinforce C++ programming skills and to learn more about encryption algorithms. I have developed this in Visual Studio Code on Windows 11, but the core code of the DLL should platform independent, but is not tested on other platforms.

### Development Rules!

- AI can be used to improve comprehension of the AES algorithm, but should not be relied upon to generate the implementation.
- The program must be written entirely in C++.
- The program must use the AES256 algorithm to encrypt and decrypt the text.
- The program must print the output for each step of the encryption and decryption process.
- The program must be well-documented and easy to understand.
- The program must be well-tested and free of bugs.
- The programm must include test cases to verify the correctness of the implementation using the NIST test vectors.

### What does the program do?

This program takes a string of text and encrypts it using the AES algorithm. The program prints the output for each step of the encryption process. The program then decrypts the encrypted text and prints the output for each step of the decryption process.

### How does the program work?

The program uses the AES algorithm to encrypt and decrypt the text. The program uses a raw implementation of the AES algorithm. The program takes a string of text and encrypts it using the AES algorithm. The program then decrypts the encrypted text and prints the output for each step of the decryption process.

### Usage
